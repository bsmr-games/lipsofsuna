"In the face of a disaster threatening to run down the operations of the library, the doors shall be sealed and the emergency procedure initiated. The initiation marks the immediate termination of the personel as the air and temperature conditions are calibrated to be optimal for the preservation of knowledge. The library shall remain sealed until a new owner has purchased the knowledge from the Keepers of Knowledge."



As instructed by the manual of rules, I have sealed the entrance of the library with my remaining powers. Everyone else has been consumed by the disaster and it would be only a matter of time until my body has decomposed past its limits as well.

To protect the rights of the Keepers of Knowledge, it is my responsibility is to activate the emergency mechanism so that the knowledge won't be used without permission.

It may very well be that there will be no one left to purchase the knowledge but all the better. At least no one will use it without permission. Regardless, I shall pull the emergency lever now.]]}
