The spell editor is used for creating spells for your character. To create a spell, you first select the quickslot to which the spell will be written. Next you select the base type of the spell: either ranged, self or touch. Finally, you choose the effects that the spells have on the target.]]},
{"paragraph", [[
There are three types of spells. The first type is ranged spells that conjure a flying projectile or other effect that is able to attack enemies at a distance. The second is spells that affect the caster herself. The third is touch spells that are cast to a target directly in front of the caster.]]},
{"paragraph", [[
Each spell can have up to three effects. Effects can be added to the spell by clicking them in the effect list in the pane to the right. The power of the effect can be changed by clicking the red bar next to the name of the added effect.]]},
{"paragraph", [[
To be able to cast a spell you need to have enough skills. The required skills are listed at the bottom of the left side pane. Increasing the power of the spell increases the skill requirements of the spell.]]},
{"pagebreak"},
{"paragraph", [[
Willpower is a special skill for spells. When you cast a spell, your willpower is consumed the amount indicated by the skill requirements. If you cast too many spells, you can run out of willpower. That will render you unable to cast the spell until your willpower has regenerated.]]},
{"paragraph", [[
Spells require and consume reagents. Reagents are often harvested from nature or crafted from harvested items. The required reagents depend on the effects of the spell. Increasing the power of the effects increases the reagent requirements.]]}}}
