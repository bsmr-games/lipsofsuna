Spells are created with the spell editor. To create a spell, first select the quickslot to which the spell will be written. Next, select the base type of the spell: ranged, self or touch. Finally, choose the effects that the spells have on the target.]]},
{"paragraph", [[
There are three types of spells. The first type is ranged spells, which conjure a flying projectile or other effect that is able to attack enemies at a distance. The second type is spells that affect the caster herself. The third is touch spells, which are cast to a target directly in front of you.]]},
{"paragraph", [[
Up to three effects can be added to a spell. They can be added to slots that have no effect yet. Activating such a slot will show a list of spell effects known to the character. Choose an effect that matches the type of your spell; one that is not grayed out.]]},
{"paragraph", [[
Willpower is needed for casting spells. Your willpower is consumed in proportion to the strength of the spell you cast. Your willpower may run out if you cast too many spells. If that happens, you will have to wait for your willpower to regenerate until you are able to cast more spells.]]},
{"paragraph", [[
Reagents are required by casting spells. A reagent a tangible material from which the spell draws its power. Reagents are consumed and disappear when used for casting spells. Most reagents can be harvested from nature or crafted from harvested materials.]]}}}
