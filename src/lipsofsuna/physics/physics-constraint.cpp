/**
 * \brief Creates a hinge constraint.

 * The constraint will be owned by the physics simulation. It will be freed
 * automatically when the object has been deleted or becomes incompatible with
 * the constraint.
 *
 * \param physics Physics simulation.
 * \param object Object to constrain.
 * \param point Pivot point in object space.
 * \param axis Axis of rotation in object space.
 * \param limit Nonzero if should use rotation limit.
 * \param limit_min Minimum angle in radians.
 * \param limit_max Maximum angle in radians.
 * \return New constraint or NULL.
