Installing the engine
=====================

To build the game, you need to have Python and the Waf build system installed,
as well as a number of dependencies listed on the project wiki. Once you have
all the requirements installed, build the game with the command:

waf configure build install



Installing the data files
=========================

If you downloaded a file release, you can skip this section. The data files are
already in their right place and you can run the game right away.

Otherwise, you need to download the data file originals from the data repository
and import the files to the engine. Do this by running the following two commands
in the directory where you compiled the game:

git clone git://lipsofsuna.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/lipsofsuna/data install/data
install/lipsofsuna -i



Running the game
================

To run the game, type:

install/lipsofsuna
